Bugs:

    * There is some problem with section interpolation when the depth
      is smaller than the depth step. Negative areas are produced even
      if the section is prismatic

High Priority:

    * Check transport at downstream boundary and at junctions under
      reverse flow conditions.  

Low Priority:

    * use an formatted hotstart as with MASS2

    * eliminate the use of link id's as array indices -- be able to
      give links nonconsecutive, but unique id's, and generate array
      indices internally

    * implement some kind of automatic scheme to determine link
      computation order. 

    * when atmospheric exchange is on met data are repeatedly
      reinterpolated; we need to recode it so that the met data is
      interpolated once for each zone and time step

    * Hydro bc tests

    * dissolved gas tests 

    * temperature test (cooling, e.g.)
