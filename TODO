High Priority:

    * BC and other tables: either (1) make sure that the beginning and
      ending dates are within the simulation, and crash if not, or (2)
      just use the first/last values before/after table start/end.

    * Check transport at downstream boundary and at junctions under
      reverse flow conditions.  

Low Priority:

    * use an formatted hotstart as with MASS2

    * recode the transport so all calculations are DOUBLE PRECISION.

    * eliminate the use of link id's as array indices -- be able to
      give links nonconsecutive, but unique id's, and generate array
      indices internally

    * implement some kind of automatic scheme to determine link
      computation order. 

    * when atmospheric exchange is on met data are repeatedly
      reinterpolated; we need to recode it so that the met data is
      interpolated once for each zone and time step

    * Hydro bc tests

    * dissolved gas tests 

    * temperature test (cooling, e.g.)
