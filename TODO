High Priority:

    * BC and other tables: either (1) make sure that the beginning and
      ending dates are within the simulation, and crash if not, or (2)
      just use the first/last values before/after table start/end.

    * There is some bug where profile output is written to time series
      output, perhaps when there is a large number of time series
      output locations.

Low Priority:

    * use an formatted hotstart as with MASS2

    * recode the transport so all calculations are DOUBLE PRECISION.

    * eliminate the use of link id's as array indices -- be able to
      give links nonconsequetive, but unique id's, and generate array
      indices internally

    * implement some kind of automatic scheme to determine link
      computation order.
