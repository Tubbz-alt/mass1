# MASS1 Utility Scripts

These utilities are provided as-is. There is little or no
documentation (except the code itself).  Some are still used often by the
authors; others are quite old and in probably in need of maintenance.  


* `bcsteps.py` 

  This is used to generate a stepped boundary condition file,
  typically used when simulating a series of steady state conditions
  in a single simulation. 
  
* `mass1bc` 

  Extracts a single field from [gage output](../doc/gage.md) and makes
  a correctly formatted [boundary condition](../doc/bc.md) file. 

* `mass1profile`:

* `profile2cgns.py`

* `profile_extract.py`

* `read.R`

* `timeshift.py`
